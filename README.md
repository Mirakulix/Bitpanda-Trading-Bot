- Complete audit trails for all trades

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- **Paper Trading Mode**: Safe testing environment for all logic
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive coverage for trading algorithms
- **Integration Tests**: API connection validation
- **Load Testing**: Real-time data processing performance
- **Security Testing**: API endpoint vulnerability assessment

## 📈 Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Docker Compose with PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB + Redis
- Paper trading mode enabled by default
- Hot reload for all services

### Production Environment
- Kubernetes cluster deployment
- Automated CI/CD pipeline
- Multi-environment support (staging/production)
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for high-frequency trading
- Comprehensive monitoring stack

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **Financial Application**: Security and data integrity are paramount
- **Paper Trading First**: All logic must be tested thoroughly before live trading
- **Austrian Compliance**: Must adhere to local financial regulations
- **Audit Trail**: All trading decisions must be logged and auditable
- **Risk Management**: Circuit breakers and risk controls are mandatory

## 📋 Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Core FastAPI backend with Bitpanda API integration
2. **Phase 2**: Paper trading implementation and testing
3. **Phase 3**: AI services integration with fallback mechanisms
4. **Phase 4**: Database design with TimescaleDB optimization
5. **Phase 5**: React dashboard with real-time monitoring
6. **Phase 6**: Data pipeline for news and social media analysis
7. **Phase 7**: Production deployment and monitoring setup
